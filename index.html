        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Cedura Project is an Excel-based automation project designed to streamline the process of generating employee salary sheets. 
            The project eliminates the need for manual updates by using formulas, VBA macros, and Power Query to automatically update data 
            for new months or new employee entries. The system includes sheets for employee details, leaves, holidays, and a template that 
            consolidates all information for salary calculation.

            <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>
                Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring that all employee records were up-to-date. 
                Power Query was used to transform and clean the data before loading it into the Excel workbook.

            <h3>Data Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Using Excel formulas like <code>XLOOKUP</code>, <code>INDEX</code>, and <code>MATCH</code>, the project automatically fetched 
                employee details, attendance, and leave records. VBA macros were used to generate individual employee sheets and automate 
                repetitive tasks.

        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Output</h3>
            <p>
                The final output was a fully automated salary sheet that could be generated for any month with minimal manual intervention. 
                The system also provided detailed insights into employee attendance, leaves, and salary deductions.
