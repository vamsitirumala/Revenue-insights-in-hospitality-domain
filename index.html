        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This project focuses on analyzing revenue trends in the hospitality industry, including hotels, restaurants, and events. The goal is to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), 
            Occupancy Rate, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and Realization Percentage. Using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX queries, the project provides actionable insights to improve financial performance and optimize revenue generation.

        <h2>Data Analysis Process</h2>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>
                Data was collected from various sources, including booking systems, customer demographics, and revenue reports. The dataset included information on room bookings, cancellations, no-shows, and customer ratings.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Data Transformation</h3>
            <p>
                Using Power Query, the data was cleaned and transformed. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and creating new columns for analysis, such as week numbers and day types (weekday/weekend).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Data Modeling</h3>
            <p>
                In Power BI, relationships between tables were established using common columns. DAX queries were used to create calculated columns and measures, such as RevPAR, Occupancy %, and ADR.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to visualize revenue trends, booking patterns, and customer demographics. Key metrics like Realization %, Cancellation %, and No-Show Rate were highlighted.
